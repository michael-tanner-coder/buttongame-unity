# BUTTON GAME
This was a personal project to convert a Javascript game I made for my family into a Unity project. However, the scope started to spiral out of control as I added more features, so I decided to give it a rest for now because it was only ever meant to be a simple mini-game. I don't want to get overinvested in another side project.

# PREMISE
Button Game is a one-button multiplayer game where you have one chance to hit a button that will save you from the Big Ol' Ticking Bomb.

Pressing your button will bring down a safety door to protect you from the bomb's explosion. But when one player's door closes, the other opens. Each player only gets one button press.

The last person to press their button will win, so press it wisely!

# CONTROLS
- Jump for player 1: W Key
- Jump for player 2: Up Key
- Move through tutorial prompts: Enter
